# Arm-Assembler-For-Kate
A simple ARM Assembly syntax highlighter file for the Kate editor.

I'm an absolute beginner with Assembly, so this is probably very incomplete.

## Installation on Linux

* Locate your user folder by running qtpaths--paths GenericDataLocation. This is normally ~/.local/share. 
* Place the armasm.xml file in the directory org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax under this directory, create it if it doesn't exist.
* Restart Kate
